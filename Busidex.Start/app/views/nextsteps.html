                    Now that your card is on Busidex, you can share your card with your business contacts using the Busidex website or
                    mobile app. If you ever need to update the information on your card, just come back here to make those changes. After
                    you save it, everyone that has your card on their phone will automatically have the updated infomration. (Brief pause to
                    take in just how awesome that is...).
