                                If you share with someone that does not have a Busidex account they will need to open an account to view
                                your card in their Busidex page. Once you have shared your card, you give those with whom you shared your
                                card the authorization to then share your card with whomever they wish. In other words, you authorize that
                                your card can be shared with anyone by anyone that has your card.
